The following are user acceptance tests:

- Given I am signed in, when I click the “Follow” button on a CSO page, then that CSO should appear in my followed list, and I should receive their updates.
- Given I am on the sign-up page, when I enter a valid Wits email address and complete the registration form, then my account should be created, and I should be able to log in.
- Given I have a registered account with my Wits email, when I enter my credentials on the sign-in page, then I should be logged into the application.
- Given I am following a CSO, when I click the Unfollow button on their page, then they should be removed from my followed list, and I should stop receiving updates from them.
- Given I am signed in, when I complete and submit a membership form for a CSO, then I should be added to the CSO’s member list.
