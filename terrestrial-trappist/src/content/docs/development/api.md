### Things to note

- API is read-only for now (GET only).
- Data comes from the events table in Supabase.
- Do not use Supabase service keys directly — always go through this API.
- API auto-updates when new events are added to Supabase.

### Future Endpoints (Planned)

These endpoints may be added later:

- POST /api/events → Add new event
- GET /api/events/:id → Get event by ID
- PUT /api/events/:id → Update event
- DELETE /api/events/:id → Remove event
