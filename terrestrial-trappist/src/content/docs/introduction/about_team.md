Bit-by-Bit is a team of five students from the University of the Witwatersrand, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Computer Applications under the School of Computer Applications and Applied Mathematics. Together, we bring a wide range of skills gained throughout our undergraduate journey, spanning Information Systems, Applied Mathematics, and Mathematics.

At the core of our team are the values of collaboration and consistency. We believe that great results are achieved when individuals contribute their unique strengths bit by bit towards a common goal. In a fast-paced and often overwhelming world, we hold to the principle that steady, small steps each day build up to meaningful progress.

The Clubs Connect Project is especially close to our hearts. As students, we understand the importance of finding a community and pursuing passions beyond academics. This project is designed to help students discover what they love, connect with others, and journey together instead of walking alone to conquer the Wits edge.

Bit by bit, we are committed to using modern technology to make an impact, change lives, and solve real-world problems. This is who we are.
