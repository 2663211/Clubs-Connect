---

The University of the Witwatersrand is known for giving students “the edge”, with course chowing, conquering the edge seems impossible and this is where CSOs step in. 
SRC Clubs, Societies and Organizations (CSOs) are an outlet from academic pressures, while also developing an individual holistically with skills that are necessary beyond university life. CSOs with similar objectives are grouped into clusters, namely:
* Political Cluster 
* Academic Cluster 
* Business Cluster 
* Social Cluster 
* Cultural Cluster 
* Religious Cluster 

Clubs Connect is a platform designed to bring CSOs to students and the Student Governance Office (SGO) to CSOs. Often than not students are unaware of the diverse opportunities beyond academics while others sign up for so many CSO activities that they struggle to keep track of their commitments. These represent the two extremes of how students currently engage with CSOs.
CSOs themselves often operate in isolation, with limited collaboration across clusters. For example, it is uncommon to see joint initiatives between religious and social clusters, or between cultural and academic clusters. Clubs Connect addresses this challenge by bringing CSOs together on one platform, creating opportunities for collaboration. By working collectively, CSOs not only save students time by consolidating events and activities but also enrich the student experience by allowing different interests and communities to intersect.

In addition, Clubs Connect strengthens the connection between CSOs and the SGO by streamlining communication and oversight. Through the platform, the SGO can create CSO pages, regulate activities, and monitor progress. At the same time, CSOs gain practical tools to manage their operations more efficiently for example, submitting requests, order forms, and other required documentation online.

For simplicity, the term CSOs in this document also includes School Councils and/or Wits Sport, since both are managed by the SGO. School Councils are sub-bodies of the Student Representative Council (SRC). They promote academic excellence, ensure accountable and transparent student leadership, encourage student participation in school events, foster social well-being and spark interest in various leadership positions taken within the school and beyond (The School Council, 2020).

The SRC, as the highest decision-making structure in student governance, offers a variety of services to both individuals and student groupings. In doing so, it exercises political, economic, and administrative authority over student life (www.wits.ac.za, n.d.).
Wits Sport, meanwhile, enriches the university experience through inclusive sporting opportunities that promote teamwork, well-being, and community spirit. With over 20 sporting codes available, it caters to all skill levels from beginners to elite competitors (www.wits.ac.za, n.d.).

Lastly, CSOs also represent the various Wits offices focused on student well-being, including the STPU, CCDU, WCCO, and others.
