description: These are the user stories
---

A user story is a brief, plain-language explanation of a feature or functionality written from a user’s point of view(ProductPlan, n.d.). It captures what the user wants to achieve and why, focusing on real people rather than abstract system functions.

The user stories for the Clubs Connect application are organised from three perspectives: Users, SGO Officers, and Executive Members.

The users are primarily Wits University students and staff who interact with CSOs through the application, SGO Officers are staff members of the Student Governance Office (SGO) who serve as application administrators, managing CSOs, assigning roles, and overseeing compliance and executive members are leaders of CSOs holding various portfolios, responsible for managing CSO activities and content, and engaging with users through the application.

The following user stories outline the key features and functions each group can perform within the application.
