## Testing Guide

### Automatic Tests

Automatic tests are done using the React Testing Library and Jest as the test runner.

### Writing Test Files

- Test files should be saved with a `.test.js` or `.spec.js` extension so the test runner can detect them.

### Installing Jest

Before running tests, install Jest in your project:

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest
```

### Running Tests

Once tests are written and Jest is installed, run the tests with:

```bash
npm run test
```

## Documentation Guide

To make changes to the document

- cd terrestrial-trappist

## Git Workflow Guide

To make sure the `main` branch always works and stays clean, we followed these steps when contributing.

### Get the latest code

Always start by syncing your local repo with GitHub.

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

### Create your own branch

Work on a new branch for your feature, bug fix, or update.

```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
```

### Do your work

- Add / edit / delete files.
- Save and test your changes locally.
- Commit often with meaningful messages(refer to git methodology).

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add login form with validation"
```

### Keep your branch up-to-date

Before pushing, always pull the latest main and merge/rebase into your branch.

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature/my-feature
git merge main
```

### Push your branch

Push your changes to GitHub.

```bash
git push origin feature/my-feature
```

### Open a Pull Request (PR)

- Go to GitHub.
- Open a Pull Request from your branch â†’ main.
- Wait for teammate responsible for main to review and merge it.
