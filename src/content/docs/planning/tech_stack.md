## Frameworks & Libraries

### Frontend

**React**
a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces using a component-based architecture. Selected for its ease of learning, reusability of components, and ability to build scalable, maintainable UIs compared to raw HTML/CSS.

**CSS**
(Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and design the visual aspects of the application. It ensures a consistent, responsive, and user-friendly interface while separating design from logic.

### Testing

**Jest**
a JavaScript testing framework designed for simplicity and integration with React Testing Library. Used to efficiently test UI components, generate coverage reports, and ensure application reliability.

## Backend

**Supabase**
an open-source alternative to Firebase that provides authentication, storage, and a PostgreSQL database. Chosen for its simplicity, scalability, and ability to handle complex relationships with SQL, making backend management faster and more reliable.

## Languages & Runtime

**JavaScript**
a versatile programming language used for frontend, backend, and testing across the stack. Unified choice for React, Supabase integration, and Jest testing, ensuring consistency, productivity, and maintainability.

**Node.js & Express JS**
A JavaScript runtime that enables backend development outside the browser. It powers the server-side logic and connects the frontend to the database (Supabase).

## Tools & Infrastructure

**Visual Studio Code**
a lightweight code editor chosen for its extensive extensions, GitHub integration, and suitability for collaborative web development.

## Project Management & Documents

### Continuous Integration

**GitHub Actions**
a CI/CD platform integrated into GitHub that automates workflows such as testing and deployment. Chosen for seamless integration with GitHub repositories, reducing the need for extra tools while supporting automated pipelines.

### Documentation

**Astro JS (Starlight)**
a static site builder optimized for documentation, supporting lightweight and fast websites. Adopted to quickly build a formal documentation site using a ready-made template, saving time and effort.

### Project Management

**GitHub Projects**
is a built-in project management tool that uses Kanban boards for task tracking. It helps the team organize tasks, assign responsibilities, and monitor progress directly within GitHub.

## Package Management

**npm packages**
(Node Package Manager) is used to install and manage third-party libraries and tools. It provides access to a vast ecosystem of reusable packages, saving time and effort in development.
